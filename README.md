# slmath ver. 2.6.0

Mathematics C++ library with GLSL shading language style classes. 
The library supports various linear algebra classes like 
vec2, vec3, mat4, etc. OpenGL Shading Language specification 
is used as reference for the functionality.

The code is very portable, besides Visual Studio 2008/2010 people 
have used the lib on iPhone, Linux, N-Gage and Symbian S60.
The code is licensed under BSD/MIT, so as free/liberal as it gets.

The library also contains a simple testing framework 
(see samples/test), which is meant for unit/regression testing 
of the slmath library, but it can be used for testing other stuff as well.


## Documentation

"documentation\slmath.chm" contains the HTML Help reference manual.

See also OpenGL Shading Language specification ("GLSLangSpec.Full.1.20.8") 
to see how the library should behave. :)


## Compatibility

Only basic C/C++ is required, so should be relatively easy to compile this on any platform.

Known to work on:

* Ubuntu/Linux g++
* VS2012
* VS2010
* VS2008
* VS2003 (thanks to Peter Ingebretson <peter at ingebretson.net>)
* iOS
* Android (NDK)
* Maemo/MeeGo (Nokia N900)
* Symbian/S60
* Samsung Bada
* N-Gage

So it should be easy to port to almost any platform. It can be compiled even
on a platform which doesn't support namespaces (e.g. BREW).


## Install/usage 

There is no external dependencies so as long as the headers are found and cpps compiled, everything should be fine.


## Using SIMD on 32-bit builds (x86)

32-bit C-runtime libs of Visual Studio don't guarantee memory alignment on 16-byte boundary in heap alloocation,
so you need to align it yourself and use following as replacements for new/deletes:

void* __cdecl operator new( size_t count )
{
    return _aligned_malloc( count, 16 );
}

void* __cdecl operator new[]( size_t count )
{
    return _aligned_malloc( count, 16 );
}

void __cdecl operator delete( void* p )
{
    return _aligned_free( p );
}

void __cdecl operator delete[]( void* p )
{
    return _aligned_free( p );
}


## Asserts in Vector Ops (_DEBUG)

Vector operations have a lot of assert checks. 
Those slow down _DEBUG build but are usually very useful to catch programming errors.
However, if you want to disable those you can comment out line from slmath_configure:

        //#define SLMATH_VEC_ASSERTS

You can also selectively uncomment per compilation unit using following trick:

        #include <slm/slmath_configure.h>
        #undef SLMATH_VEC_ASSERTS
        #include <slm/vec4.h>
        // ...


## About some design decisions (free functions vs member functions)

The choice between member function vs free function depends on case.
There are different things to consider:

Compatibility/similarity with GLSL has always been one of the project goals.
So if GLSL specs have a function done in one way, this lib most likely follows it.
That explains a large number of free functions.

Enabling const-usage. For example, if normalize() would be a modifier member function
use like this:
v.normalize()
then you cannot use const expressions like this:
const vec3 v = normalize( vec3(1,2,3) );
(actually, there is both now, but that's just an example)

Minimizing sources of errors. If one form reduces errors and other form
increases them, the error-reducing form is used.
